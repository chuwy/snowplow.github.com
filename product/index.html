    <h2>Record events from anywhere.</h2>

    <p>Snowplow enables you to record rich, granular, event level data from your website, mobile applications, desktop applications, server-side systems and third party applications.</p>

    <p>This data provides a record of everything that has occurred in your business, providing a solid foundation for building insight and using that for taking intelligent action.</p>

    <p>Our [large library of open source trackers] [trackers] enable you to track and generate data from your own systems.</p>

    <p>In addition, we support ingesting data from a growing number of third party providers via [webhooks] [webhooks].</p>

    <h2>Structure, enrich and model that data.</h2>

    <p>We do not simply let you collect and warehouse event-level data. We run a sophisticated data pipeline that:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Validates your data to ensure that it conforms the associated schemas. Unlike our competitors, we do not ignore malformed data - we provide it back to our users so they can address the issue at source and reprocess the data if necessary</li>
      <li>Enriches the data. Our  enrichment framework enables us to perform dimension widening on captured data using third party data sets: for example, parsing and categorising referer, inferring device, browser and operating system information from useragents or locating users based on their IP addresses, for example</li>
      <li>Models the data. As well as delivering event-level data for sophisticated analysis, we enable our users to model the data, including applying:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Identity stitching algorithms to figure out which events belong to a particular user, and aggregate over that user's data to create an update to date record for her in user-level table</li>
      	<li>Sessionize events - grouping events together into logic flows that correspond to specific user actions</li>
      </ul>
  </ul>

    <h2>Load the the data into your own data warehouse to power sophisticated analysis.</h2>

    <p>We deliver your event-level data to you in **your own datawarehouse**. That gives the ability to:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Join your event-level data with other data sets, including customer data sets (e.g. CRM), marketing and campaign data (e.g. Adwords), product and merchandising data and financial data</li>
      <li>Perform sophisticated analytics including: Customer / marketing analytics, catalog / merchandising analytics, product analytics</li>
      <li>Develop predictive models</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Make that data available to real-time data processing applications via Amazon Kinesis.</h2>

    <p>Snowplow is your company's digital nervous system. We can deliver your event-level data to an Amazon Kinesis stream, so that you can build data-driven applications that consume that data and take intelligent decisions based on it.</p>

    <p>Your data scientists can build models based on the complete historical data set in the Snowplow datawarehouse, and then put those models live on the data coming in production.</p>

    <p>Just think about what that makes possible.</p>
